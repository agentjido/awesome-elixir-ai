## **Mission**

Advance the **higher-level AI ecosystem** for Elixir/BEAM \- empowering developers who ship production-ready agentic and LLM-driven applications.

## **Our Focus**

**A Community that builds Agentic Software with Elixir**

We maintain and evolve tools for:

- Building autonomous agents and workflows  
- Integrating LLMs into production systems  
- Sharing patterns for AI applications on BEAM

## **What We Do**

- **Curate** an awesome-list of packages that work seamlessly together  
- **Educate** through tutorials, examples, and partnerships  
- **Maintain** packages to ensure compatibility and ease of use

- **Support** developers via Discord discussions and office hours  
- **Build** starter templates and integration guides  
- **Showcase** monthly highlights of production AI applications  
- **Fund** integration bounties for connecting to AI services

## **Anti-Focus**

- Low-level ML infrastructure (Axon, Nx)  
- Gatekeeping or exclusive membership  
- Formal governance or heavy process  
- Competition with existing ML communities
