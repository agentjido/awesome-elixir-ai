# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Awesome Elixir AI! Please take a moment to review these guidelines.

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Package Name](link) - Description.`
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.

## Quality Standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the Elixir AI community
- Actively maintained (or explicitly marked as archived/unmaintained but still useful)
- Stable or progressing toward stability
- Documented
- Tests (if applicable)

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Thank you!

Your contributions are always welcome and appreciated. Thank you for helping to make this list better!
